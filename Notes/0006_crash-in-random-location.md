### Notes

-   After entering a few bills manually, the application crashed when pressing the export button.
    I have not yet tried to reproduce this issue.

-   When the crash occurs, I am in some random location without debugging symbols avaliable.

-   I have seen similar crashes before, not sure if this is related or not.

-   I was not able to reproduce the issue again.

    -   This does not appear to be related to scrolling.

    -   This does not appear to be related to keyboard navigation.

    -   This does not appear to be related with overwhelming the application.

    -   This does not appear to be related with doing something while exporting.

### Ideas

-   I could try to disassemble the location where the debugger stops.
